This experiment is about how allowing multiple threads affect the speed of matrix multiplication code,at first it decreases the time taken then after that the overhead due to the creation of theads becomes the dominating factor.
The results of the experiment is in the RESULTS.pdf with the graph of Time taken Vs Number of Threads
This was done on Ubuntu (16.04) with the help of Virtual Machine on Windows
